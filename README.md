<img src="docs/images/bigsky-stars.jpg">

The Big Sky Catalog is a compilation of various Star and Deep Sky Object (DSO) catalogs, tailored for the purpose of visual observation of our beautiful night sky. Currently, it includes the following objects:

|   | Count  | Sources | Details |
|---|---|----|--|
| **Stars** | 2,557,499  | Hipparcos, Tycho-1, Tycho-2 | [details](docs/stars.md) |

\*_The image above was created with [Starplot](https://github.com/steveberardi/starplot), by plotting the brightest 981,852 stars from the Big Sky Catalog._

## Roadmap
Future versions will include objects from these catalogs:

- Messier
- New General Catalogue (NGC)
- Index Catalogue (IC)
- Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS)
- Gaia DR3

It's still very much a work in progress! Help is wanted and appreciated :)
